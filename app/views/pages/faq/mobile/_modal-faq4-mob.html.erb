        <p>YES. Sharing a container is legal as long as each shipment is declared to customs. <br> <br>

        All shared-containers listed on mygroupage are compliant with departure and arrival countries' customs regulations. <br>
        To prevent hiccups at customs, only customers who can provide a complete set of documents for customs qualify to share a container. All "co-shippers" are therefore assured that no hiccup will arise at customs because of a missing document. <br> <br>

        Some countries have no clear procedure in place for relocationsâ€™ shared-containers (Brazil being one of these countries for example). Please note that
        mygroupage does NOT list any shared-container that sails from or to those countries.
